    "The relocation company that specializes in relocating finance professionals between New York and London needs a tool to help their customers find suitable neighborhoods/districts of the city they are moving to by narrowing down a list of potential areas based on their location preferences in their home city.\n",

    "In most cases, customers are not familiar enough with the city they are moving to, making the process of finding the new living location a time consuming and stressful activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be greatly facilitated by customers' knowledge of their home city and its areas. By identifying what area(s) in their home city the new location should resemble, the cluster analysis can narrows down the list of the areas to consider to a few that the customer should further research/visit before making final decision.\n",

    "The analysis approach consists of two stages: 1) creating profile for each area, and 2) area segmentation based on their profile similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create area profiles, venue location data provided by Foursquare is obtained for each area from both New York and London datasets, and then aggregated by venue categories. Only areas with at least 100 venues reported are retained for further analysis. Next, aggregated venue data for the target New York neighborhood is added to the the aggregated venue dataset for London. This combined dataset is then converted into  each area profile by calculating the frequency with which various venue categories appear. In other words, the distribution of venue categories in each area serves as that area profile. Using this approach, data in area profile is normalized and allows for direct comparison between areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second stage of analysis, areas were segmented applying k-means clustering method to area profiles. This relatively simple model is fast and sufficient for the complexity of the task at hand, and will allow for adding further dimensions to area profiles in the future."
